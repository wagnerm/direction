# Direction

Are you like me and like in a windy state? Do you like planning your training routes to be in headwind on the way out and tailwind on the way back?

Then this project might be for you. Welcome to Direction!

This project aims to provide you with information about wind direction so you can plan your outdoors training route accordingly.
